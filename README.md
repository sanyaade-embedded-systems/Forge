What is it
----------

Forge is a parser for a HyperTalk-like programming language named Hammer. It is written in C++ and generates output for the Leonie bytecode interpreter and runtime.


How to build
------------

To build the sample project (which creates a command-line tool), check out the Leonie repository into the same folder as Forge, and build the Forge Xcode project.


License
-------

I'm still thinking about a license to open source this under. I've previously released code under a zlib license, but I'm not sure I want to be that liberal with Leonie and Forge.

Right now, consider all of this copyrighted and non-distributable until I've made a decision.

I'm open to well-reasoned suggestions, though.
